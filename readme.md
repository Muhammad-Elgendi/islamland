This site was deployed to https://islamland.net
and it's UI was the first I ever make
also it was my first time using Laravel framework

From google news, I got the idea to fetch the content from multiple sources and view the content in an organized way. The first step of the process was to get the latest content from a certain site by parsing feeds from this site and get the new URLs and check for updates periodically. Then I scraped the page of the content and store the text of the page it in the database along with the timestamp, category and the source of the content. Finally, it provides the user with the content in a clean UI.
